I want to name my table **tbl_users** and create four column names with a *Primary Key*.

As you can see, I create four different column name:  
ID (Primary Key), Username, Coins, Diamonds.

You've noticed that we have to check first what type of constraints we should use for each name. 

| Initials | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PK | Primary Key |
| NN | Not Null |
| UQ | Unique |
| B  | Binary |
| UN | Unsigned |
| ZF | Zero Fill |
| AI | Auto-Increment |
| G  | Generated |
